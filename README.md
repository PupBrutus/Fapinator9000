# Fapinator9000
I got tired of watching porn the old fashioned way... this was the over engineered result. The program will randomly cycle through a series of nested folders including any subdirectories for videos, then will play 6 random videos at the same time on 6 players infront of you, randomly jumping into 'gif' (however you want to pronounce that) like clips. Recent over-engineered details for this fap-toy include keyboard shortcuts to both skip clips that are on an individual screen or focus on them making them full screen. 

Note from author: 
Alright well this is my sorry attempt at making someone feel proud of me for this - lord knows it wont by my mother.

TIPS
=========
Definitly lower the quality of your video archive - it absolutly can't do HD movies (atleast not my on my computer) I would encourage you to go to https://handbrake.fr/ and use the included handbreak encoding preset. 
	
I would strongly encourage you this takes atleast a moderate computer to run with atleast one internal SSD and graphics card/good CPU - it would likely distroy a tradtional hard disk due to the excessive HD reading that needs to happen - use this application at your own risk. 

As an encouraged addition I've successfully used trinusvr.com to stream this to my google cardboard... it's nice... 

=========
Pre-Reqs/Install:
=========
You'll need the VVVV enviroment you can easily download it from VVVV.org and you will also need the add-on pack downloadable from the same site. https://vvvv.org/downloads
Download lots of videos or video clips of your choosing and place/orginzie them in a single folder
Download the entire repo including the /loadscreen/ folder 
	currently the app can crash if the default loadScreen directory doesn't have atleast some content
Double click the Fapinator9000 file and the application should load with further directions and keycommands - internal readme included below: 

Fapinator 9000 v3.9.5
****if you only see one video pres the numpad ./del key****
Code is locked with CTRL+E
How to use this program: 
Primary Controls: 
Fullscreen: HOME key
Play/Pause: END key
Master Mute/UnMute: Numpad3
Boss Mode (hides screen... sorta...): Numpad1
Refresh Aspect Ratio Calculation: Numpad2

This program has the tendancy to bug out on occasion - if so just close/reopen. 

First select your video stream folder from the box marked "Open"
Then use keyboard shortcuts to full-screen/play the video folders. 

There are some input boxes below to tinker with settings, as well as a (barely) functional GUI for many controls but I don't really encourage using them as many can also be buggy or cause logics to fail. 

Video Skipping - you can skip to a new video new time within just a single video stream by pressing the numpad key corresponding to the same video player of that screen. 

Numpad Key
7 8 9
1 5 6
Corresponding Screen
0 2 4
1 3 5

Focus Mode: 
Holding down Numpad0 before using one of the Video Keys will focus that video to be the only one on screen and turn off continous skip mode for that video. To clear out of focus mode you can press the Numpad. or Del key. -- Advanced option to the right to enable/disable the clip looping while in focus mode to continue to play the movie from that point.
